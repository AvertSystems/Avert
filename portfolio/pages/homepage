<a style="text-decoration:none;" href="/system-administration"><h2 id="sysadmin" style="color:#8F37FA;">System Administration</h2></a>

<p style="color:black;margin-bottom:60px;">Select this service if you require routine maintenance for your on-site or local systems. Routine tasks include software installations, configurations and updates, creating backups, scheduling tasks to run at a specific time, task automation and troubleshooting. Most of this is done with the use of custom made scripts which I write and implement on your system. These scripts can be very simple, spanning only a few lines, or quite complex with hundreds of lines of code. It all depends on your needs. Contact me to get started!</p>

<a style="text-decoration:none;" href="/web-design"><h2 id="web-design" style="color:#8F37FA;">Web Design</h2></a>

<p style="color:black;margin-bottom:60px;">Select this service if you are looking to update or launch a website. You may choose the option of having a mockup of your website created before hand to clearly identify how you want your site to look. From there, I will update your sites HTML and CSS to bring your mockup to life. As an alternative, I can suggest Wordpress themes that provide your site with the look and feel you specify. Once you approve of the design for your site, I will create it and keep you informed every step of the way. SEO will be integrated seamlessly so that your site will be visible and easy to find for clients on the web. After your site launches, feel free to contact me for any additional maintenance your site may need.</p>

<a style="text-decoration:none;" href="/system-development"><h2 id="sysdev" style="color:#8F37FA;">System Development</h2></a>

<p style="color:black;margin-bottom:60px;">Select this service if you are looking to improve upon or create a new system from scratch. A system can be an inventory system to keep track of available products or a customer database tracking sales to identify trends and grow your business further. As the graphic shows, there are 7 steps in this process. The first step is to identify a new system to be made or ways to improve upon a system already in place. In this phase you will detail to me what problems you want to fix and what opportunities you would like to seize. From there, you will outline to me the requirements for successful completion of the project including project deliverables and any timelines you would like to keep. Once all this information is gathered, I will do an in depth analysis to determine how to implement all the requirements of the new system, creating any applicable charts and diagrams detailing how the system will be implemented with an estimated time of completion. Once the new system design is agreed upon, I will build it, along with supporting documentation of how to operate and maintain the system. Once the system is built, it must be tested to ensure it is working correctly before going into production. Finally, the system will be deployed in a production environment where it will be monitored and evaluated for further improvements. </p>

<a style="text-decoration:none;" href="project-management"><h2 id="project" style="color:#8F37FA;">Project Management</h2></a>

<p style="color:black;">Select this service if you are looking to design and implement a system more efficiently. This service is basically a subset of system development where you must identify problems you would like to fix and opportunities you want to seize. Determine requirements for successful completion of the project including project deliverables and any timelines you would like to keep. Once all the requirements are gathered, I do an in depth analysis to determine how to implement all the requirements of the new system, creating any applicable charts and diagrams detailing how the system will be implemented with an estimated time of completion. At this point, I assume a supervisory role, advising you and your development team as needed. With the charts and diagrams created during this process, you will be able to plan and manage your project to meet strict deadlines, improve efficiency and rapidly transition your project from development to a production environment.</p>
